            Perhaps the only benefit to this is a reduced price,<br />
            but at the cost of low quality products,reduced workforce<br />

            My name is Christopher Jasper. Ever since I<br />
            was a boy I have always been fascinated by blacksmithing and
            carpentry.<br />
            I began my career as a welder and fabricator but found my real<br />
            passion was for wood and carpentry,<br />
            living in the wooded hills of <em>North Idaho.</em> After first<br />
            beginning carpentry under Mr Jeremiah Leake,<br />
            I started my own business making caskets<br /> (St Joseph's Caskets),going
            on to build my own house - by myself - and<br />
            then working under
            <small>Gary Marston of Marston's Custom Cabinets</small><br /> before
            transitioning into my own <mark>JASPER WOODWORK</mark>

            Most custom woodworking companies charge<br />
            a price that most cannot afford.<br />
            I price my services more competitively to save you money<br />
            without com-promising on quality design and construction.<br />
